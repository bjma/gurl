# gURL
Essentially a shitty cURL CLI implementation in Go which basically simulates HTTP requests. I wrote this in order to familiarize myself with Go, as well as to refresh myself on networking concepts.

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/bjma/gurl
```

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bjma/gurl.git
