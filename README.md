# gURL
Essentially a shitty cURL CLI implementation in Go. I do realize the redundancy of this package (it has no applicable use), I wrote this in order to learn Go and familiarize myself with its net functionality.

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/bjma/gurl
```

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bjma/gurl.git
cd gurl
go install
```
